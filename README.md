# Overview

This is a You Robot softcore script, using the [grimoire](https://github.com/Kasekopf/grimoire) framework. It is a fork of [loopgyou](https://github.com/Kasekopf/loop-casual/tree/gyou).

### Strategy

The script is designed to be run as part of a loop. In particular, it expects that something like [garbo](https://github.com/Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society/garbage-collector) will use the rest of the turns. This means that profitable daily resources (e.g. copiers) are avoided, but other resources (free runaways, kills, some wanderers) are used to save turns where possible.

### Installation

To install the script, use the following command in the KoLMafia CLI.

```
git checkout https://github.com/Kasekopf/looprobot release
```

### Usage

1. In aftercore, run `looprobot sim` to verify that the script is installed, and to confirm that you meet the requirements (see below for more details). Unlike `loopgyou` and `loopsmol`, the set of requirements to make the script run well is much longer.
2. Ascend into a You Robot Softcore run.
   - **Class:** Myst classes are preferred. Non-myst classes should work, but you may have issues if you don't have **both** a genie bottle and a cursed monkey paw.
   - **Moon sign:** Vole is strongly preferred, regardless of class. Other signs may work but are much less tested.
   - **Astral pet:** Any should work; they don't make a big difference to the run.
3. Run `looprobot` and watch it go! If you are more hesitant, you can run `looprobot actions 10` to only do 10 things and stop.

Options can be changed in a few different ways:

- In the Mafia relay browser, select `looprobot` from the dropdown in the top right. Be sure to `Save Changes` after modifying a setting.
- By setting a mafia setting, e.g. `set looprobot_pulls=18`.
- By providing an argument at runtime, e.g. `looprobot pulls=18`. Note that any arguments provided at runtime override relay and mafia settings.

Run `looprobot help` for the full set of script commands and options:

```
> looprobot help

This is a script to complete You Robot Softcore runs. Run "looprobot sim" without quotes to check if this script will work for you.

You must ascend manually into a You Robot Softcore run before running the script. Seal Clubber under a Vole sign is recommended for now. Astral mask or astral belt are both useful, but neither is required.

The arguments accepted by the script are listed below. Note that you can combine multiple options; for example "looprobot pulls=18 fax=false" will save 2 pulls and avoid using a faxbot. Most options also have an associated setting to set an option permanently; for example "set looprobot_pulls=18" will cause the script to always save 2 pulls (unless overriden by using the pulls option at runtime).

Commands:
  sim - Check if you have the requirements to run this script.
  version - Show script version and exit.
  help - Show this message and exit.

Major Options:
  pulls NUMBER - Number of pulls to use. Lower this if you would like to save some pulls to use for in-ronin farming. (Note that this argument is not needed if you pull all your farming items before running the script). [default: 20] [setting: looprobot_pulls]

Minor Options:
  fax BOOLEAN - Use a fax to summon a monster. Set to false if the faxbots are offline. [default: true] [setting: looprobot_fax]
  seasoning BOOLEAN - If true, get special seasoning from SongBoom boombox. Not advised if you constantly run low on meat. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_seasoning]
  lgr - Pull a lucky gold ring. If pulled, it will be equipped during many combats. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_lgr]
  profitfamiliar - Use free familiar turns for familiar related profits. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_profitfamiliar]
  pvp - Break your hippy stone at the start of the run. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_pvp]
  wand - Always get the zap wand. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_wand]
  forcelocket - Always equip the combat lover's locket, in order to get monsters inside quickly. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_forcelocket]
  skipbackups - Don't use any Backup Camera Backups. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_skipbackups]
  savelocket NUMBER - Number of uses of the combat lover's locket to save. [default: 0] [setting: looprobot_savelocket]
  saveapril NUMBER - Number of Apriling Band instruments to save. [default: 0] [setting: looprobot_saveapril]
  luck NUMBER - Multiply the threshold for stopping execution when "you may just be unlucky". Increasing this can be dangerous and cause the script to waste more adventures; use at your own risk. [default: 1] [setting: looprobot_luck]
  saveparka NUMBER - Number of spikolodon spikes to save (max 5). [default: 0] [setting: looprobot_saveparka]
  saveember - Should we save the Sept-Ember Censor for aftercore? [default: false] [setting: looprobot_saveember]
  voterbooth - Attempt to use the voter booth if we have access. [default: true] [setting: looprobot_voterbooth]
  stillsuit FAMILIAR - Equip the stillsuit to this familiar during the run [default: Gelatinous Cubeling] [setting: stillsuitFamiliar]
  flyer - Always flyer the normal way, instead of wishing for a monster [default: false] [setting: looprobot_flyer]
  chronolith - Skip spending turns to get net positive turns from chronolith at the end of the run (turn on to minimize turncount at the expense of aftercore turns) [default: false] [setting: looprobot_chronolith]
  nuns - Do the nuns in the war; uses monkey paw wishes [default: false] [setting: looprobot_nuns]

Debug Options:
  actions NUMBER - Maximum number of actions to perform, if given. Can be used to execute just a few steps at a time. [setting: looprobot_actions]
  verbose - Print out a list of possible tasks at each step. [default: false] [setting: looprobot_verbose]
  verboseequip - Print out equipment usage before each task to the CLI. [setting: looprobot_verboseequip]
  ignoretasks TEXT - A comma-separated list of task names that should not be done. Can be used as a workaround for script bugs where a task is crashing. [setting: looprobot_ignoretasks]
  completedtasks TEXT - A comma-separated list of task names the should be treated as completed. Can be used as a workaround for script bugs. [setting: looprobot_completedtasks]
  list - Show the status of all tasks and exit.
  settings - Show the parsed value for all arguments and exit.
  ignorekeys - Ignore the check that all keys can be obtained. Typically for hardcore, if you plan to get your own keys [default: false] [setting: looprobot_ignorekeys]
  halt NUMBER - Halt when you have this number of adventures remaining or fewer [default: 0] [setting: looprobot_halt]
  warby NUMBER - Halt when your turncount is above this number and you haven't started the war [default: 150] [setting: looprobot_warby]
```

### Manual Installation

If you would like to make your own modifications to the script, the recommended way is to compile and install the script manually.

1. Compile the script, following instructions in the [kol-ts-starter](https://github.com/docrostov/kol-ts-starter).
2. Copy `looprobot.js` and `looprobot_choice.ash` from KoLmafia/scripts/looprobot to your Mafia scripts directory.
